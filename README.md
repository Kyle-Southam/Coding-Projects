Hello, and welcome to my coding projects that I have done through the years. 

In this repo, you will find different MATLAB coding projects that have been done using principles learned in the classroom.
To use this code, you will need to run them on MATLAB. Various projects will require certain add-ons to run.

If a program requires multiple function files to run, the script to use them will be refered to as "main" while the functions
retain their original name.

I hope you enjoy! It was fun to make these projects and applying what I have learned.
